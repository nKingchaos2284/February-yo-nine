## Description

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation
${installation}
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description.

## Usage

${usage}

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots.

 To add a screenshot, create an \`\`\ folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

 <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ixady4Wjhh2hny0-4sQi3Y-ZE4rFjyc8/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
     
 

 ## Credits
 ${contributing}

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

## License

${renderLicenseSection(license)}
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badMath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests
${test}
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
